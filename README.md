Car parking monitoring and management system project is trying to provide autonomous parking system intended for specific group of people, such as tenants of specific building, or parking of the specific institution. Parking system that is developed in this project is able to, with no additional human interference, function and manage whole parking. Meaning, it can let correct users in and out of the parking based on the database of all allowed users provided. Then, it keeps track who entered, who exited parking, how many users and which users are currently on the parking. 
 
For all this, system has GUI application which allow manager of the system to supervise the system. Manager is able, through the GUI application, to monitor all allowed users, all active users (users that are currently on the parking), to add or delete users from the database. Manager is also able to manually control hardware parts of the system (ramps).
